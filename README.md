# django-timetable
  Hello readers! I am Hrithik Pawar . 

I am presenting you a simple but useful project. 

I developed a webapp using Django where you can create a time table for your educational institution.  

Here you can register, login, logout, create table and edit table.  

I made it as dynamic as possible and used eye pleasing colours to style it.  

I used Djangoâ€™s default database which is sqlite database.
